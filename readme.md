This project was developed as my first MVC framework project using Laravel. I learned alot while developing this project and it gave me insight into how to convenient and organized development becomes once you get used to a MVC framework and especially Laravel.
This project is live @ http://139.59.20.26 .There maybe certain features that may not function properly and still there are few bugs that need to be fixed. (As it is my first experience of hosting a website using VPS - Virtual Private Server, there are certian configurations that I need to make so that all the features of website start functioning as expected!!)

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
